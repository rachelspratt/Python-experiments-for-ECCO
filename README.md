These are experiments downloading ECCO model data (llc90) to practice Python environment; work with monthly data, take model mean, rotate tiles, use Dataframes, graphing.

Thank you to Ian Fenty, Ou Wang, Gael Forget for the original documents used to create this vertical advection of salinity tutorial in tile 7.  I have borrowed from the tutorial found ont these pages: https://ecco-v4-python-tutorial.readthedocs.io/_sources/intro.rst.txt
Thank you also to Andrew Delman for advice on how to rotate tile 7 and encouragement on getting started with Python.
This file and others has some step by step prcesses including accessing data from the ECCO repositories with Python.  Additional files will inclde instructions on how to access data with AWS.
