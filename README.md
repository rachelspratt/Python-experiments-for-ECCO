# Python-experiments-for-ECCO
These are experiments downloading ECCO model data (llc90) to practice Python environment; work with monthly data, take model mean, rotate tiles, use Dataframes, graphing.

Thank you to Ian Fenty, Ou Wang, Gael Forget for the original documents used to create this vertical advection of salinity tutorial in tile 7.  I have borrowed from the tutorial found on these pages: https://ecco-v4-python-tutorial.readthedocs.io/_sources/intro.rst.txt
Thank you also to Andrew Delman for advice on how to rotate tile 7 and encouragement on getting started with Python.
This file and others have some step-by-step processes including accessing data from the ECCO repositories with Python.  

(ECCO Version 4 Release 4 is a recent edition of the
global ocean state estimate and estimation system described by Forget et al. (2015b, 2016).)
